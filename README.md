CrimeRate Analysis: A Python Project

Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of crime data using Python. The dataset contains information about various crimes, including details such as the crime date, time, location, description, weapon used, and more. The goal of the project is to provide insights into crime trends, distribution, and use predictive modeling techniques to forecast crime patterns.

The dataset is cleaned, analyzed using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and then a predictive model is created to predict the type of crime based on various features. A Random Forest Classifier model is chosen for this task due to its ability to handle both numerical and categorical data efficiently and its performance in classification problems.
